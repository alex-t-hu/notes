- Arne Sucksdorff
	- a divided world. some small white furry mammal hides in a hole, while the wolf looks around. An owl hears the furry call and flies to confront the wolf.

	- at the end there's a dissolve into the image of a candle, meditative moment generates. a feeling of anti-revolution and reflection.time is running out in some way, candle is running out. provides the viewer with a choice to do revolution or not

	- mirrors and shadows are pseudodopplegangers
- Fredric Jameson's "Nostalgia for the Present" (1989) is a critical essay that engages with postmodernism as a cultural phenomenon, focusing on the way contemporary society relates to history, memory, and aesthetics. It is part of his broader critique of postmodernity
- Slavoj Žižek, David Lynch as a Pre-Raphaelite (2025)
	- Pre-Raphaelite paintings often present a flatness, lacking the depth of perspective introduced during the Renaissance. This creates an effect where reality appears as a relief, a characteristic he finds mirrored in Lynch's films
	- Both the Pre-Raphaelites and Lynch imbue their subjects with a "dollish," mechanically composite quality, leading to an uncanny and unsettling atmosphere
	- Lynch's work reveals disturbing elements beneath idyllic surfaces. For instance, in Blue Velvet, the camera transitions from a serene suburban scene to a close-up of insects beneath the grass, symbolizing the hidden darkness in everyday life
- David Keith Lynch was an American director, screenwriter, visual artist, musician, and occasional actor. He was known for his surrealist, disturbing, and mind-bending films and TV shows, which brought a dark artistic vision to the mainstream
- Cat People (1982 film)
	- the cat is uncanny
	- The Fear of Repressed Desires

	- The protagonist, Irena Dubrovna, fears that she will turn into a panther if she becomes sexually aroused or emotionally overwhelmed. This taps into Freud’s idea of the uncanny as the return of repressed emotions.The film plays on anxieties surrounding female sexuality, portraying Irena’s transformation as both seductive and monstrous, making her both a subject of desire and fear.The Doppelgänger Effect
	
	- Irena has a dual nature—both human and potentially feline. Her identity is unstable, mirroring the Freudian notion of the double (Doppelgänger) as an unsettling presence that undermines personal identity.
	The film plays with mirrors, reflections, and shadows to reinforce this idea, making Irena seem like a haunted version of herself.
	The Uncertainty Between the Real and the Supernatural
	
	- Much of the film’s horror comes from suggestion rather than explicit imagery. It is never fully clear whether Irena actually transforms into a panther or whether her fears are psychological in nature.
	This ambiguity makes the supernatural elements feel even more unsettling because they remain just beyond the viewer’s grasp.
	Uncanny Use of Shadows and Sound
	
	- Shadow play and off-screen horror are used to generate unease. For example, the famous "Lewton Bus" scene—a sudden cut to the sound of a bus hissing like a panther—subverts expectations and creates a jarring moment of uncanny terror.
	Scenes like the swimming pool sequence, where Irena’s presence is suggested through shadows and eerie growls rather than shown explicitly, create the sensation that something invisible yet familiar is watching.
	Blurring of Human and Animalistic Traits
	
	- Irena’s transformation is implied rather than directly seen, making her both human and inhuman at the same time.
This tension between what is recognizably human and disturbingly other is a hallmark of the uncanny.

	- the lumber truck repetition and diner scene
	- stereotypical things taken to the extreme. sandy is dating captain of football team, captain of football team shows up to beat him up. adds to humor
	- time and anchronisticity. the boombox is from the 80s. stuff is during 50s.
	- postmodernism is taking images from concrete eras and mixing up in powerblender
	- film is obsessed with signs and posters
	- some scene breaks the 180 degree rule by taking shots that cross the line btwn Jeffrey/others and Frank/Singer. this mirrors dorothy singing in the club. person singing and not actually singing. acousmatic sound with the stuff happening in the room behind the door. there's a jump cut when frank suddenly disappears from the scene. the dissolve and cut to the road scene adds to the dream-like feeling. 
	- theme abt rooms being empty when its actually not. low-angle light makes the singer look creepy. bad maekup. now its dark seems to be a switch in the characters head.

	- "the soundtrack invented silence"
	- "hide the ideas, but so that people find them. the most important will be the most hidden"
	- rejection of non-theatrical acting called them models, use of chance and spontaneity, sound is used to expand the unseen image, cinema was compromised by its theatrical roots, while cinematograph was a pure, independent art form, juxtaposition of images to create meaning, would never work again with a model he worked with once
	- use of non-action instead of action. how does time pass, use of space (turns to the same space with a musical rhythm), thresholds (doors, glass)
	- psychosexual tension which binds him to close intimate contact w other men. there's also a women who he keeps at a certain controlled distance. 
	- the ending "what strange path led me to u" (is he actually saying this, or is it imagined). "rich ambiguity" is a signature of rich ambiguity. they are together but also separated by bars

	- perpendicularity to cuts, diagonality. everyone is framed at a 45 degree angle. disorientation of the viewer. space is cutup in geometric, formal ways, sequence of surfaces.
	- not exactly realism, transcendentalism

	- dialogue is almost sung, words feel like prayers, words are repeated, image is black-white, referencing sculpture-staleness, framing creates dynamic image thrust right at you.
	- Moses. and Aaron
	- Sicilia! is a film abt a man returning to Sicily from NY and meeting his mom. His mom did some cheating with some other man? She doesn't like his father

		- super long take on the guy to see his gestures. the reaction is witheld
		- super long shot on the train track, we focus on the birds. similar to oshima, recognizable physical space

		- bull fight is a primal scene of cinema
		- small microphones planted inside of costumes
		- zero communication when shooting. life-death situation makes it hyperrealistic
		- in the car, no possible other place to put camera because no space
		- in elevator, some low-angle shot
		- the guy has many costumes but only wore a couple. this enables easier filming.
		- in bullfights there's 3 aspects of crowd, fighter, bull. why no shots of the crowd? because the crowd is right-wing; the film is not about society, it's about ritual
		- the scene about undressing. why was it placed where it was? it's a nice transition. shouldn't be near beginning/middle, takes people out of the film. the dressing scene is a cliche. the information is interesting, even for the creator, like how the buttons need machines to be controlled and pull up clothes and fix tie (tie can be dangerous). the man's aesthetic body.
		- the ending of the film zooms away. it's like end of a dream, the audience becomes real audience not viewers.
		- sound. quality of film has to be uniform. if not, it feels bad, so need to increase quality
