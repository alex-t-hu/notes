### RSA

### DH
secure key exchange over insecure channel
$p\gg 1,g$ shared
Alice chooses private $a$, generates $A=g^a\mod p$.
Bob chooses private $b$, generates $B=g^b\mod p$.
Exchange $A$ and $B$ and compute shared secret $s=g^{ab}$.


### History
1982: R, S, A incorporate in Belmont MA
1983: MIT gets a patent; new company gets license
1984: few hires funding round move West
1986: RSA 'Surive & Boostrap Plan' 1986. evangelize, productize, standardize, distribute. MAILSAFe, BSAFE, tlaks, RSA conference, IETF, ANSI, IEEE, CCITT, PKCS, license broadly, embed root key, specialized r&d, consulting, rsa laboratories, secure trusted 
1987: first RSA hire, MailSafe sales modest/needed revenue. BSAFE product general availability.
Project Overtake is a competitor
1988: DEC becomes customer. MIT doubles down on RSA. new company CERTCO is envisioned. RSA headcount 6.
CERTCO & RSA need to be separate - CERTCO needs to be transparent, independent, not controlled by RSA or any single entity to maintain public trust
1989: "Internet" endorses RSA algorithm. NOVELL becomes customer. Former Prof. Rivest student Burt Kaliski joins RSA
1987 - Computer Security act of 1987
1990 - An actr of Congress, oversigh thearing, Apple becomes partners. The battle lines drawn on products, policy, standards
1991 - RSA signs Microsoft (brealy), Apple, Sun, IBM, GE Info Svcs., and more. PKCS Consortium formed. RSA factoring challenge. EFF founded. DSA announced by NIST, designed by NSA. First RSA Conference.
1991 - Comprehensive Counter-Terrorism Act of 1991. Electronic communication systems should allow Government to obtain plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications
1991 - RSA's technology mentioned by Bill Gates. PKCS consortium is launched 1991 with Apple, Novell, Lotus, and Microsoft. Industry support for RSA Data is significant because the company's technology is seen as something of a hot potato by the NIST
1992 - RSA Laboratories formed. Bernstein and others go to court over export. Freedom to use crypto becomes a cause celebre among civil liberties orgs.
1993 - Clipper Chip appears. Escrowed encryption ("LEAF") introduced. RSAREF released for free non-commercial use. NeXT reluctantly signs up
Mitch Kapor founded Lotus, this spreadhseet thing
1994 - Pressure mounts for RSA support in NIST standards, NSA continues to reists. historic new partner for RSA - Netscape. NSA steps back, FBI steps in . First atetmpt to form CERTCO.
1995 - WWW explodes, browsers from Netscape and Microsoft are available to download. VeriSign formed. VISA, Intel, Ameritech, Mitsubishi, and others become strategic investors. RSA Japan and VeriSDign Japan subsidiaries formed. Licensees of BSAFE grow to over 100.
1995 - Verisign. brand: RSA. product (BSAFE): mature, proven, distributed, based on standards. IP: Established and defended. Control of Distributed and Enabled Root keys in BSAFE
1996 - RSA merges with SDI, becomes pubilc
MIT shares in RSADSI endowed RSA chair of eecs
