### Macro
GDP is total market value of all final goods and services
GDP = C + I + G + (X – M) (good market clearing condition)
- MPC heterogeneity leads to multiplier 1/(1-MPC) to be more than 1
GDP
- **Wages and Salaries:** Compensation for labor.
- **Rents:** Income from property.
- **Interest:** Earnings from investments.
- **Profits:** Corporate earnings.
GDP = value added at each stage of production (revenue - intermediate goods) = labor costs + profit

Aggregate demand vs Aggregate supply. x-axis is output/real GDP/ total demand. y-axis is price level. short-run aggregate-supply is upwards; Aggregate demand is downwards; long run aggregate-supply should be constant of price level. because the output is more than natural; firms and workers notice higher prices so SRAS shifts left/upward until natural output is reached again, but at a higher price level.

IS-LM is a purely demand based way of looking at things.
IS-curve (investment-savings) is nominal interest rate vs real output, and it is downward sloping. captures equilibrium in goods market. investment is a function of output and interest rate. expansionary fiscal policy like reduce taxes and increase spending will increase output.
$Y=C(Y-T)+I(Y,r)+G$ and it should be extended to include expectations $Y=A(Y,T,r,G,Y^e,T^e,r^e,G^e)$
LM-curve (liquidity-money) has to do with money supply and is upward-sloping or horizontal. real money demand $M^d=L(i,Y)=Y L(i)$, and supply fixed $M$ by central bank, so $M/P=YL(i)$ (using real units), in practice $M$ is adjusted to fix $i$ captures equilibrium in financial markets. the financial market equilibrium graph has nominal interest rate (people care about nominal interest rates when holding money) on y-axis and real output on x-axis. $M^s/P$ is graphed as a vertical line and $YL(i)$ is graphed as downward-sloping curve. expansionary monetary policy increases money supply with bonds/lowers interest rate
expansionary monetary policy increases $M$ to lower $i$ to account for an increased $Y$ 
$I=b_0+b_1Y-b_2(i-\pi^e +x)$ where $i$ is nominal interest rate, $\pi^e$ is expected inflation, $x$ is risk premium, $c_1+b_1<1$ normally

structural unemployment is natural unemployment. we assume a production function proportional to employment. the reservation wage is indifferent wage. workers have bargaining power.
wage-setting by workers, they have some notion of expected price level (W is aggregate nominal wage) $W=P^e/(1+u)$ 
price-setting by firms, firms try to mark-down wages from price level. $P=(1+m)W$ 
real wage y-axis, unemployment rate x-axis
phillips curve says inflation and unemployment have inverse relationship. inflation rate on y-axis and unemployment rate on x-axis. though, stagflation can occur. it can be derived by the above equations.
$\pi_t-\pi_t^e=-\alpha(u_t-u_n)$ and $Y_t=N_t=(1-u_t)\cdot L$ , so alternatively phillips curve can be change in inflation rate against output
Okun's law - 1% increase in unemployment will usually be associated with a 2% drop in gross domestic product (GDP)

expected present discounted value - value in the present of some future stuff. generally, we know the interest rate $i_{11}$ and have to estimate interest rate later $i_{1t}^e$ 
yield to maturity on a n-year bond is constant annual interest rate that makes today's bond price equal to PDV of future payments
default risk - bond issuer doesn't pay back full amount promised. price risk - uncertainty about price that bond is worth in future before maturity
permanent income hypothesis - ppl consume based on permanent income, average income over lifetime, temporary increase little effect
life-cycle hypothesis - ppl plan consumption and saving over entire life
in practice $C_t=C(TotalWealth_t, Y_t-T_t)$. financial wealth is assets minus debt (EPDV), human wealth is EPDV of labor income
investment depends on current and expected profits and current and expected real interest rates

$Y=F(K,N)$ growth is function of capital and labor; technological progress increases $Y$. Increases in capital per worker generally lead to decreasing increases in output per worker
$Y_t/N_t = f(K_t / N_t), f'>0, f''<0$, $I_t=S_t=sY_t$, $K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_t+sY_t$
Population growth $K_{t+1}/N_{t+1} \sim (1-\delta - g_N)K_t / N_t + sY_t / N_t$ 
Technological progress takes forms of larger quantities of output for given capital and labor, better products, new products, large variety within products, state of technology $A$, so $Y=F(K,AN)$. Assume constant returns to scale, so $Y/AN = f(K / AN)$. We get roughly $K_{t+1}/(A_{t+1} N_{t+1}) - K_t / (A_t N_t) \sim s Y_t / (A_t N_t) - (\delta + g_{AN}) K_t / A_t N_t$. 
in another model, $H=e^{\psi u}N$, $Y=K^{1-\alpha}(AH)^{\alpha}$, per-worker growth $g_y = (1-\alpha)g_k + \alpha g_A + \alpha g_h$.

real exchange rate - price of domestic goods relative to foreign, $\epsilon = EP / P^*$ , $P$ is price of US goods in dollars, $E$ is exchange rate, $P^*$ is price of foreign goods in foreign money
Exports satisfies $X=X(Y^*, \epsilon), X_{Y^*}>0, X_{\epsilon}<0$ (foreign income, real exchange rate)
$IM=IM(Y,\epsilon),IM_Y>0,IM_{\epsilon}>0$
$NX(Y^*,Y,\epsilon)=X(Y^*,\epsilon)-IM(Y,\epsilon)/\epsilon,NX_{Y^*}>0,NX_Y<0,NX_{\epsilon}<0$  (marshall-lerner condition)
Equilibrium in goods market in open economy is $Y=C(Y-T)+I(Y,r)+G+NX(Y,Y^*,\epsilon)$, rewrite $r=i$, $\epsilon=E$ since domestic and foreign process are fixed
Equilibrium in open financial markets is capture by interest parity - $E_t = (1+i_t) / (1+i_t^*) E_{t+1}^e$, which means $i_t$ is domestic and $E^e$ is expected future exchange rate
Peg currency means $E^e = E$, so domestic interest rate equal to foreign. Lose independent monetary policy, but gain nominal exchange rate stability, important for trade.

Deficit $DF_t=rB_{t-1}+G_t-T_t$, $B_t$ is debt, seigniorage is printing money

## Psychology
### time preferences
exponential time discounting model because
positive time preference - prefer receiving goods or benefits sooner than later
consistency - preferences are consistent across time
diminishing marginal utility of consumption - each additional unit consumed provides less satisfaction than previous unit

Exponential discounters - Consistent and rational discounting over time. Commitment devices neither help nor harm them significantly because they plan and follow through consistently.
Naïve hyperbolic discounters - Unaware of their future self-control issues. Typically benefit from commitment devices as they help prevent impulsive decisions.
Sophisticated hyperbolic discounters - Fully aware of their future self-control issues. Use commitment devices to counteract anticipated self-control problems and thus benefit from them.
Partially sophisticated hyperbolic discounters - Partially aware of their future self-control problems. May incorrectly estimate their future behavior or the degree of self-control issues. These individuals can be harmed by commitment devices because they might misestimate their future preferences or constraints. They could overly restrict themselves and thus make worse-off decisions, harming their welfare.

### risk preferences
diminishing marginal utility of wealth
constant relative risk aversion utility function $u(c)=c^{1-\gamma}/(1-\gamma)$ , CARA $u(c) = e^{-\alpha c}/ \alpha$ 

alternatively, we have prospect theory. a reference point and the utility looks like a sigmoid passing thru the origin
- V(-x) < -V(x)
- endowment effect - ppl overvalue items they own compared to don't own
- rejection of small-scale gambles (-100 vs 110)
- housing market behavior - homeowners overprice houses relative to market conditions when selling
- marathon finisht imes - marathoners speedup before hitting a round-number goal

### social preferences
pro-social
- ppl care abt others, not just themselves. these games may not reflect pro-social, because ppl could be saving money for others, rly need the money, etc ...
dictator 
- one person, the dictator, is given money and decides how much of it to share with another participant
- dictators tend to offer 20-30%
ultimatum
- proposer offers x to responder. responder knows x and total amount, accepts or rejects
- proposers typically offer 40-50%, and <= 30% frequently rejected
- why do responders reject low offers? 1 -> responders dislike coming out behind proposer. 2 -> responders dislike being treated unfairly and are willing to punish proposer for unfairness
trust - amount given to responder tripled
distributional preferences - represented purely in terms of amount of money (or other resources) people get
social-image concerns
- ppl don't wanna look bad
- Bursztyn and Jensen (2017). individual $i$ in reference group $j$ does action $a_i\in \{0, 1\}$ revealing information $\sigma_i\in \{\ell, h\}$
- Dana et al. 2017. Dictators choose btwn (6 for self, 1 for other person) or (5 for self, 5 for other person), 26% choose the first option. However, adding the (6, 5) vs. (5,1) case, participants sometimes choose not to find out -> ppl don't want to look bad in front of themselves
intentions-based preferences
- include reciprocity (ppl like to treat others how others treating them)
- procedural justice (fairness in process used to allocate resources)
- other facets of social preferences that imply ppl care abt how allocations came abt
Breza et al.
- pay disparity lowers work performance for all team members
cullen and perez-truglia
- workers underestimate how much managers make, elasticity of effort wrt manager salary = 0.15, elasticity of effort wrt peer salary = -0.7
bandiera et al. 2005
- measure productivity in fruit farm as function of two payment schemes, piece rate (per unit of output), relative pay, find workers more productive when doing piece rate
rao 2019
- having poor classmates made rich students more prosocial, generous, and egalitarian
Lowe 2020
- collaborative interactions is working on the same team. with cross-caste interaction in cricket leagues, increases friendship
- adverse interactions decreases friendship
Mousa 2020
- soccer matches among christian iraqi refugees. results did not generalize to non-soccer
pluralistic ignorance (katz 1931)
- ppl might have incorrect about others' views, misperceptions can persist for long time
bursztyn et al. (2020a)
- pluralistic ignorance where men believe less men believe women should work outside the home than reality. when this is remedied, more women work outside the home 
kumar and epley
- undervaluing gratitude; overestimate awkwardness

### Attention
dichotic (simultaneous stimulation of left and right ear by different sounds) listening experiments Broadbent (1958)
DellaVigna, 2009 - perceived value $\hat{V} = v+\theta o$, where $\theta$ is attention weight
salient taxes (excise tax) vs non-salient (sales tax)
seaweed farmers didn't pay attention pod size, even though it was important. this happens often.

### Utility from beliefs, learning
Anticipatory utility is utility derived now from anticipating future; prime example of utility from beliefs
Loewenstein (1987)
- willing to pay now to obtain/avoid certain experiences. typical discounting for money, but for kisses (3 days best for anticipation) or shocks (right now best)
- Huntington's disease model. Probability $p$ of Hd-negative, with utilities $u(\pm)$. anticipatory utility $f(p)$. Will seek info if $pf(1) + (1-p)f(0) > f(p)$, information loving. overoptimism leads to higher utility than realism.
Thornton (2008) & Ciancio (2025)
- rural malawi HIV test information experiment. With incentives, 34% -> 68% learned HIV results, and HIV-positive who learned results have higher mortality
Weinstein (1980) - overoptimism
- students make judgements of their own and other students' chances for a number of outcomes. Comparative judgement - how much more or less likely average student thinks event will happen to them relative to average student; optimistic/pessimistic ratio - number of students who think chances are better than average classmate's, divided by number who think chances are worse
- many such cases of optimism; 90% drivers think they're better than average
Taylor and Brown (1988) - positive illusions promote psychological wellbeing, overconfidence is vital for mental health
Barber and Odean (2001) - men tend to be more overconfident than woman generally. Inflated beliefs explained by anticipatory utility/ego utility, utility abt one's traits and abilities
Eil and Rao (2011) - people update beliefs more rationally (Bayesian) given favorable news, but tend to discount unfavorable news, noisy posterior, helps ppl maintain overconfidence
Zimmermann (2020) - motivated memory; ppl remember good more than bad
Malmendier and Tate (2005) - managerial hubris - overconfident managers long holding stock options
Barber and Odean (2001) - overconfident small-scale investors, men trade 45% more than woman and lose money
Exley and Nielsen (2022) - gender gap in confidence, expected but unaccounted for
Why do ppl fail to learn? attention limited, wrong theories of world, derive utility from wrong beliefs, or bad at Bayesian learning
- base-rate neglect - ignoring/underweighting base rate of event
- gambler's fallacy - next outcome different. ppl know the distribution. Bayes law of small numbers
- hot-hand fallacy - next outcome same - gilovich (1988)
- chen et al. 2016 - judgements made in court have negative autocorrelation
### State-dependent preferences, projection and attribution bias
- preferences change over time. short-term fluctuations, long-term systematic changes, adaptation to life changes
- Nisbett and Kanouse (1969) - shopping on empty stomach
- Muraven and Baumeister (2000) - self-control is muscle that replenishes over night. lack of self-control may cause poor sleep
- sleep - sleep deprivation = weight gain, tired ppl more cyberloafing, effect on ethical behavior, naps increase savings and reduce present bias
- addiction (badger et al. 2007) - vary state of deprivation/timing of heroin addicts, median WTP changes
- Anesthesia Schelling 1984 - ex ante no anesthesia, once in pain, request it, and ex post, regret choice. reduced pain, but side effects; change in experience
predicting preference changes - projection bias
- it's state-dependent vs. time-dependent for present bias
- people under-appreciate changes in preferences, projecting current preferences onto future preferences
- buying more on an empty stomach (hungry ppl act as if future taste for food will reflect current hunger)
read and van leeuwen 1988
- ppl who are currently hungry/satiated vs. future hungry/satiated - understand direction but underestimate magnitude of change
loewenstein 2003 - a model of projection bias
- $\hat{u}(c_s, s_s) = (1-\alpha)u(c_s,s_s) + \alpha u(c_s, s_t)$ is the predicted future utility at time $s>t$ of consuming $c_s$ in state $s_s$, $\alpha$ measures projection bias
addiction - initiation, quit and recidivism
- relevant state is person's level of addiction, unaddicted has false sense of control projecting non-addicted preferences into future, might try smoking thinking they can quit but can't
projection bias explains depression/suicide since depressed ppl project depression to the future
attribution bias
- when judging value of good, ppl are overly influenced by state in which they previously consumed it
- more likely to return to restaurant first tried when hungry, more likely to negatively rate movie seen while tired
- $\hat{u}(c_t,s_t) = (1-\gamma) u(c_t, s_t) + \gamma u(c_t, s_{t-1})$ 

### Happiness and well-being
- economists use utility to describe preferences that rationalize observed choices, Kahneman calls reveals preferences "decision utility"
- hedonic consequences of choices, "experienced utility"
- memory of hedonic experience exhibits "duration neglect", remembered utility follows peak-end rule (evaluations are average of peak affective response during episode and end value recorded just before termination of episode)
	- Cold pressor (Schreiber et al 1993) - short trial is 14 water, long trial is 14 and then 15 water, 65% subjects repeat long trial, so decision utility is not experienced utility (total utility)
	- Colonoscopy (Katz 2003)
		- RCT with two groups - control group is regular colonoscopy and treatment is procedure lengthened by 1 min with colonoscope inside body but stationary
		- treatment had better memories
- happiness
	- strack 1988 - correlation btwn general happiness and happiness with dating, if general happiness question asked first 0.16, otherwise 0.55. shows "priming effect"
	- kumar and epley (2008) - random acts of kindness leads to better mood than predicted ...
	- wealth, friends, sleep, etc ... are correlated to happiness

### Social media and well-being
- long-standing concerns that media harm youth, like even radio and television
- green bubbles for androids help apple
- we're in a bad equilibrium abt social media

### terms
**classical economics**
externalities
different private costs and benefits
risk aversion

**psychological**
present bias - people care abt present utilities more than anything that's not present
probability weighting - ppl dont use correct probs
social image concerns
trust - people trust differently
loss aversion - avoid loss than get gains
hard paternalism - prefer choosing outcome themselves
